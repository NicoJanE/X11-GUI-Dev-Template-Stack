# What
This is a Docker Linux (Ubuntu 24.04) general purpose template container with GUI output to an X11 server on a Windows host. The container is **designed** for use on a Windows Docker Desktop host, enabling the **development** of **GUI applications** within a **Docker container**. Additionally, the container can be used to run other Linux GUI applications.

This container consists of a **Base Container** and several **Sub Containers**. **The Base Container** is ***required*** for any **Sub Container** and provides the infrastructure for outputting GUI data from the Linux application to the X11 server on Windows. 

The **Sub Containers** contain development environments for GUI application running on Linux.

> ### Preview Markdown Files(.md)
>
>To preview the Markdown (.md) files in this project, one of the solutions is to open these files in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and install the plugin: **Markdown Preview GitHub Styling** (Tested with version 2.04). Other plugins, or plugins for other programs, may not always work correctly with the file links in the documentation. I use the file link syntax supported by GitHub (Jekyll), which is also compatible with the above-mentioned plugin.
