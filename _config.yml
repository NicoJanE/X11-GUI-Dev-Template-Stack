# Add this variable to your _config, it indicates the directories where the other Mark 
# Down(MD) files can be found, so that Links in the left side bar can be created to these 
# files. The 'index.md' will use this variable to automatic append to the links
#
# Note that to make the links in the left content page work you have to define theme 
# (in order) to the top of the markdown file, like:
#
# ---
# layout: default-c                         # Use this custom template layout!
# RefPages:                                 # Array definition
#   - howto_create_A_dev_container     
#   - howto_create_A_dev_container          #'RefPage' indicates a link page displayed 
#                                           # in the left content pane.
