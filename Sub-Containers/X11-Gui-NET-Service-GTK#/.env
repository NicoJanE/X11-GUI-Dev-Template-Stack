# For Docker running Window Containers, not sure about Docker Linux
# THIS DOES NOT WORK in COMPOSE FILE:
#
#     env_file:                               # THIS horrible feature, does not work with sub directories or/and alternative names
#      - ./cra.env                            # Forget about it, it just DONT work!
#
#	For this reason all variables are mixed-up in one .env file (said but true)
